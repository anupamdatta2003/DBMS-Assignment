Database => A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and sorted in a way that 
            allows for efficient retrieval, updating and management of information.

Example for the need of a database => Imagine one is running a small online bookstore. He needs to keep
                                      track of various aspects of his bussiness; like: customer information,
                                      inventory, orders, sales etc. Without a database he cannot manage
                                      data as his bussiness growns.

                       3> Efficient retrieval
                       4> Scalability
