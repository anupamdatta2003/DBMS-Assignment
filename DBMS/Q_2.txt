File base storage system => File-based storage systems have been the backbone of data storage for decades,
                            providing a simple and familiar way to organize and access data on computers.
                            In this system, data is stored in individual files, each with its own name and
                            location within a directory structure. Uers interact with these files through
                            applications that read, write and manipulate data as needed.


Major challenges of a File-based storage system => 1> Data redundancy
                                                   2> Limited data sharing
                                                   3> Limited Scalability
                                                   4> Security concerns
                                                   5> Lack of data integrity
