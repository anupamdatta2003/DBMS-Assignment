Significance of data modelling => Data modeling plays a vital role in database design, offering a structured approach to organizing data for efficient access and manipulation.
                                  It serves as a blueprint, ensuring that databases accurately represent real-world entities and their relationships.
                                  The significance of data modeling is multifaceted. Firstly, it facilitates clarity and understanding among stakeholders by providing a common language to communicate data requirements and constraints effectively.
                                  Secondly, it ensures the accuracy and consistency of data storage and retrieval processes, thereby reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.
                                  Moreover, data modeling enables scalability and flexibility, allowing databases to adapt seamlessly to changes in data volume and complexity without requiring extensive structural modifications.
                                  Lastly, data modeling streamlines the database development process by providing guidelines and standards, assisting developers in translating business needs into database schemas efficiently.
